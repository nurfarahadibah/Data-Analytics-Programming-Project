## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze global healthcare trends, focusing on the relationships between medical doctors, health expenditure, mortality rates, and the prevalence of diabetes. Using data analytics techniques, we seek to uncover patterns and insights into healthcare disparities across different continents and time periods.

## Research Questions
1. What are the trends for the number of medical doctors, health expenditure, mortality rate, and prevalence of diabetes across continents per year?
2. What is the relationship between the average number of medical doctors per 10,000 population and the average health expenditure per capita across different regions and time?
3. What is the difference in health expenditure per capita across continents, and how does it relate to adolescent mortality rates?
4. What are the trends in adolescent mortality rates globally?
5. How does the prevalence of diabetes affect adolescent mortality, and does healthcare expenditure lessen its impact?
6. How does the prevalence of diabetes correlate with health expenditure per capita across different continents and time periods?

## Datasets
This project utilizes four datasets sourced from the WHO website:
- **Medical Doctors** (per 10,000 population)
- **Current Health Expenditure per Capita** (in US$)
- **Adolescent Mortality Rate** (per 1,000 age-specific cohort)
- **Prevalence of Diabetes**

## Methodology
- **Data Collection:** Publicly available datasets on global health statistics
- **Data Processing:** Cleaning and transforming the data for analysis
- **Data Analysis:** Statistical and machine learning models to uncover patterns
- **Visualization:** Graphs and charts to illustrate findings
- **Interpretation:** Discussion of results and policy implications

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `sklearn` (for model training and evaluation)
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy, StandardScaler (for normalization)
- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R-squared Score (RÂ²)
